Bluetooth 4.0), it is a low-power wireless technology used for connecting devices with each other and the key term here is low-energy and what this means is that BLE is targeted more towards applications that need to consume less power and they need to run on batteries for longer periods of time (months or even years). BLE was introduced back in 2010 as part of the Bluetooth 4.0 spec, it is not an upgrade to the original Bluetooth but rather it\u0026rsquo;s a new technology that utilizes the Bluetooth brand, but focuses more on the Internet of Things (IOT) applications, where small amounts of data are transferred at lower speeds. BLE operates in the 2.4 Ghz ISM band, which is the same spectrum that is used by the Bluetooth classic (the original Bluetooth), and Wi-Fi as well as some other wireless technologies such as Zigbee.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re more familiar with the Bluetooth that we use for like streaming audio, that kind of Bluetooth is referred to as Bluetooth Classic, one important thing to note is that Bluetooth Classic is not compatible with BLE, so a BLE device cannot communicate directly with a Bluetooth Classic device, so for example your SmartWatch cannot communicate directly with your wireless headphone, but rather some devices implement both BLE and Bluetooth Classic and allow communicating to these devices independently, for example your SmartPhone. with your Smartphone you can connect to both your SmartWatch and your headset.\n","description":"Get to know what is BLE.","id":33,"section":"learn","tags":null,"title":"What is BLE ?","uri":"/learn/ble/what-is-ble/"},{"content":"Some of the most common ones include home automation applications: such as a smart door lock, smart appliance or in your lighting system. Another application would be in fitness devices such as wearables and trackers. One other interesting application is an indoor location technology where GPS may not be feasible, and last but not least medical devices and personal health devices. And now with the recent release of Bluetooth 5 and Bluetooth mesh, BLE has more feasible applications especially when it comes to home automation and industrial applications.\nIn BLE there are two kinds of devices, you have a central device and a peripheral device. The central device is usually the more capable device in terms of CPU power, or memory, or battery capacity, whereas the peripheral device is much more resource constrained especially when it comes to the battery. Now BLE is an asymmetric technology and what this means is that much of the heavy lifting and the processing responsibility is put on the central device versus on the peripheral which actually allows the peripheral device to sleep for longer periods of time, turn off the radio and consume less power, so it may last longer. But really what makes BLE so special and what are some of the benefits of using BLE, well there are a few major ones that I can think of :\n  Lower power consumption: Even when it is compared to other low power technologies, BLE is one of the lowest power consumer out there.\n  Free access the official specification documents: For some other technologies you may have to become part of a group and pay some fees to access their documents. For BLE it\u0026rsquo;s free.\n  Lower module and chipset costs: BLE chipsets and modules prices are going down very rapidly.\n  Existence of BLE in most Smartphones of the market:\nThis really gives it a huge advantage over the other technologies out there.\n  The way that BLE achieves its optimized and low power consumption is by turning off the radio as much as possible and sending small amounts of data over low transfer speeds. So for example: applications such as video streaming, or high quality audio streaming, or transferring large amounts of data are not really suitable for BLE, but rather it\u0026rsquo;s meant for transferring data from small devices such as sensors to a Smartphone.\n","description":"Get to know the most common BLE applications.","id":34,"section":"learn","tags":null,"title":"BLE Applications","uri":"/learn/ble/ble-applications/"},{"content":"The range typically can go up to 50 meters (150 feet), that\u0026rsquo;s line of sight. whereas when you have obstacles and walls in between the devices, the range can go down significantly, probably to several meters or even several feets.\nHowever when utilizing the long range feature of the Bluetooth 5, the range can go up pretty significantly even up to 800 meters line of sight. The most common factors that can limit the range are:\n The surrounding environment around the BLE devices. The antenna design of the device. The orientation of the devices that are communicating to each other.  ","description":"Get to know what is the BLE range.","id":35,"section":"learn","tags":null,"title":"BLE range","uri":"/learn/ble/ble-range/"},{"content":"In terms of Speed, there are two important concepts to understand, there’s one called the raw data rate and the other one is the application data rate. The raw data rate is simply the rate at which the radio transmits the data over the air, and it varies depending on the version of the Bluetooth that is used. So for example using the Bluetooth 4.2, the raw data rate is set to 1 Mbps, however using the Bluetooth 5 and later, the raw data rate can vary, and there are different options here: either the 1 Mbps, which is the original BLE data rate, or the 2 Mbps when utilizing the higher speed feature of Bluetooth 5. But when using the long-range feature of Bluetooth 5, the speed and the data rate goes down to 500 kbps or even down to 125 Kbps. For the application data rate and how much data can the application layer actually utilize, well that gets reduced due to the packet overhead and some gaps in between transmitting some of the packets, for example: when settign the raw data rate to 2 Mbps, up to 1.4 Mbps application data rate can be acheived.\n","description":"Get to know the BLE Speed.","id":36,"section":"learn","tags":null,"title":"BLE Speed","uri":"/learn/ble/ble-speed/"},{"content":"At a high level, there are two different modes that a BLE device can operate in, it could either be advertising mode where it sends out data for other devices to discover it, or it could be in connection mode or connected to another BLE device. The difference between the two is that in advertising mode the data is sent in one direction, only from the broadcaster, whereas in connection mode the data is being transferred between the two devices, so the data transfer is bi-directional. Now keep in mind that in order for a connection to be established between two BLE devices the broadcaster has to advertise first, and allow the connection to be established from the other devices that discover it, so it has to go through the advertising stage before it gets into the connected mode. Based on those two modes there are two main categories of BLE applications, we have applications that are broadcast oriented: where a device may simply be broadcasting data for others to discover it and maybe not allow a connection to be established with that device (ex:Beacons). on the other hand we have connection oriented applications, in that case the two devices will be connected to each other, synchronized and exchange data on a regular basis, this allows for more complex use cases and applications, say for example a SmartWatch or a fitness tracker connected to your Smartphone.\nIn BLE there are 40 RF channel, that are utilized by the radio. They line the range from 2402 MHz to 2480 MHz, these channels are separated by 2 MHz center to center. Three of them are exclusively used for advertisements, though these are called the primary advertisement channels and they\u0026rsquo;re highlighted blue and this diagram, these channels are channels number 37 38 and 39, the remaining 37 channels which are labeled 0 to 36 are used for data transfer during a connection. But they are also used for what\u0026rsquo;s called secondary advertisements which was introduced in Bluetooth 5.\nThe Generic Access Profile or GAP for short, defines two main aspects one of them being how devices discover each other which includes scanning and advertising, and the other being how devices connect with each other, and also how they manage that connection afterwards. To expand on that, some of the specific aspects include the different roles of devices, the different modes that they operate in as well as the advertising and connection parameters and last but not least security.\nFor the roles within GAP, there are four different roles and they\u0026rsquo;re split up into two symmetrical pairs. first we have the broadcast observer pair, and then we have the central peripheral pair. A broadcaster is a device that sends out advertisements, but does not allow a connection to be established with it, on the other hand the observer is the device that reads these advertisements and looks for the other devices, but also does not initiate a connection with these advertising devices. Now on the other hand the central device is a device that looks for devices that are advertising and initiates a connection with these devices, and same goes for the peripheral the peripheral device is a device that advertises but also allows connections to be established With it. Now keep in mind that a single device can play multiple roles at the same time, so for example your Smartphone can be in the central mode while communicating with your SmartWatch, but it can also act in the peripheral mode while communicating with your PC, and it can do this all at the same time.\nThe GAP roles we talked about describe the type of device, but then within GAP we also have different modes, and a mode is a state that a device can switch to in order to achieve a certain goal, so it can be temporary. Some of the different modes include broadcast mode, where the device sends out advertisements but does not allow a connection to be established, whether it\u0026rsquo;s discoverable or not Connectable, whether it\u0026rsquo;s bonded to another device for a secured connection on not. And last but not least the periodic advertising mode, which was introduced in Bluetooth 5.\n","description":"Get to know what GAP means in BLE.","id":37,"section":"learn","tags":null,"title":"GAP","uri":"/learn/ble/ble_gap/"},{"content":"Basically the advertisements are the packets that are sent out by a broadcaster, or a device that wants to be discovered and then possibly be connected to. These advertisement packets are sent out on the three primary advertising channels which are 37 38 and 39 and possibly only on a subset of them, and that repeats at a fixed interval and for a period of time. Advertisement packets have different types, they can be either connectable or non connectable, scannable or non scannable or scannable. what scannable means is that a device can send a request for additional data from the advertiser in what\u0026rsquo;s called a scan request and that advertiser responds with a scan response which includes the additional advertisement data being sent. Other types of advertisements include being directed, undirected. What directed means is that an advertising device can target a specific device that it wants to be connected to or that it wants to send its advertisement data to. The most important parameter related to advertisements is the advertising interval, this value defines how often a device sends out advertising packets, and during this interval the device will send out one advertising packet on each of the primary advertising channels or on a subset of these channels. Both the value of the advertising interval ranges between 20 milliseconds and 10.24 second, in small increments of 625 microseconds. Now keep in mind that this value greatly impacts the battery life, and must be chosen very carefully. So it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to choose the longest advertising interval that can still satisfy an acceptable user experience, while achieving the lowest power consumption possible for your device. An advertising packet can contain many types of information, but most commonly it will include the following:\n  A device name: which makes it more user friendly during discovery.\n  The transmit power (TX): value which -along with the RSSI- will allow the discoverer, to approximate the range to the device.\n  Universally Unique Identifiers UUIDs: for the services that this advertising device supports.\n  Sometimes the 31 bytes (the maximum advertisement data capacity) is not enough to send out the necessary data, in this case we can use what\u0026rsquo;s called a scan-request scan-response, think of it as an additional advertisement data that can be sent out by the advertising device, but only when requested from the device doing the discovery.\nThe advertisement data was capped at 31 bytes, but now with the new extended advertisements, the capacity is increased to up to 255 bytes. The way that advertising extensions work is by the device sending out that primary advertisements which then contain information on how to locate in time and frequency the secondary advertisements, which are called extended advertisements. These extended advertisements are sent out on the secondary advertisement channels we mentioned earlier which are the same as the data channels used during a connection. Another new feature introduced in Bluetooth 5, is the periodic advertising mode, periodic advertisements are simply extended advertisements, but are sent out continuously at a fixed interval. For example, think of a use case where we have a sensor device that\u0026rsquo;s gathering data, and we have other multiple scanner devices that need to continuously monitor the sensor device, in this use case we can use the periodic advertisements to continuously send out the sensor data that could be changing over time to these multiple scanner devices without having to form a connection between in them.\n","description":"Get to know what Advertisement in BLE means","id":38,"section":"learn","tags":null,"title":"Advertisements","uri":"/learn/ble/ble_advertisements/"},{"content":"Connections are a way to establish persistent data communication that is synchronized, and allows data to be exchanged between two devices. We’ve talked about advertisements before and how there are one-way in terms of the direction of the data transfer, from the broadcaster or the peripheral to the devices that are scanning for these advertisement packets. Connections on the other hand are bi-directional data transfer, between the two devices.\nBefore we get into the details of how connections work, let\u0026rsquo;s go over some important terminology. We already learned about the central and peripheral roles, and these exist before a connection is established. However once we have a connection, and the central device connects to the peripheral, the central becomes known as the master, and the peripheral known as the slave. The master has a responsibility of managing the connection, and having the ultimate say in the connection parameters. Now that we understand what connections are and why they\u0026rsquo;re important, let’s take a look at how they work: it all starts with the peripheral sending out the advertisement packets, allowing the central to discover it. once the central device discovers a peripheral, it may decide to initiate a connection. Now the central is the only device that can initiate the connection, the peripheral role is simply to advertise its ability to accept connections.\nIn Bluetooth 5, connections can now be initiated on the secondary advertisement channels, but for sake of simplicity let\u0026rsquo;s focus on connections that are established on the primary channels. So the peripheral starts advertising on each of the primary channels, with a type of advertisement that tells the discoverer that it can accept the connections. The central now discovers one of these advertisements and decides to establish a connection with the peripheral, so it sends back on the same RF channel a connection request packet, at this point the connection is considered to be created. Now after a certain period of time called the connection interval the now called master sends a data packet to the slave, and once the slave receives this data packet it decides to send back another data packet, and at this point the connection is now considered established. A connection request packet includes a few important parameters that are needed to keep the connection synchronized and persistent between the two devices, such as the connection interval, the slave latency, the supervision timeout, the channel map and the hop sequence. Now let\u0026rsquo;s look at each of these connection parameters in more detail. First we have the connection interval parameter which defines when a connection event occurs, now at each connection event the master starts by sending a packet to the slave, the slave then responds with a data packet and includes any data that it needs to communicate back to the master, in the event that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any data to send back to the master, the slave is still required to send back something. So it simply sends back an empty packet. The connection interval parameter ranges from 4.5 milliseconds and 4 seconds, in increments of 1.25 milliseconds. next we have the slave latency parameter, we just mentioned that at each connection event, and after the slave receives a packet from the master, it needs to respond with another packet with one exception, and this is where the slave latency parameter comes in. so the slave latency defines the number of connection events that a slave can skip. The master still wakes up and sends a packet at each of the connection events, but the slave simply ignores the event and can stay asleep. this allows us to keep the slave asleep for longer periods of time when no data is available to send back to the master, but it would still be able to have quicker data transfers when necessary. a slave latency value of zero (0), means that the slave will not skip any connection event, and will always wake up to receive and respond to data packets from the master.\nAnother important connection parameter is the supervision timeout, this is the period of time since the last data exchange from the other device, at which the connection is considered lost, and this value ranges from 100 milliseconds to 32 seconds in increments of 10 milliseconds. It’s important to note that there\u0026rsquo;s a relationship and restrictions on both the slave latency and the supervision timeout values, though the supervision timeout needs to satisfy the following equation in relation to the slave latency given that the maximum slave latency is at the value of 500.\n Supervision_timeout \u0026gt; (1 + Slave_latency) x Connection_interval x 2 Slave_latency \u0026lt;= 500  As we mentioned before during a connection, 37 of the 40-RF channels are used for communication, and exchanging data between the connected devices. Now each connection event occurs on a different RF channel. The channel map defines the channels that are used for this frequency hopping mechanism and this list of channels is defined by the master in the connection request packet as we saw earlier. The channel map allows the connected devices to avoid certain channels that may be noisy, or have a lot of interference from other devices in the area. This brings us to the channel hopping increment, which is the value used to determine the next channel that devices will tune to for the upcoming connection event .for example in the case we started at channel 0, and we had a hop increment of 5, then the next channel to be used will be channel number 5 , and the next will be 10 and so on. If the hop channel calculated goes beyond channel 36 (max of the secondary channels), then it rolls over and circles back and continues counting from the beginning of the map. Now if the channel calculated is not included in the channel map, then it is mapped to a different included channel using a specific formula.\n","description":"Get to know what Connections in BLE.","id":39,"section":"learn","tags":null,"title":"Connections","uri":"/learn/ble/ble_connections/"},{"content":"Markdown here\n","description":"test post","id":40,"section":"tutorials","tags":null,"title":"Related content","uri":"/tutorials/relatedcontent/"},{"content":"Markdown here\n","description":"test post","id":41,"section":"tutorials","tags":null,"title":"Page Resources","uri":"/tutorials/pageresources/"},{"content":"Markdown here\n","description":"test post","id":42,"section":"tutorials","tags":null,"title":"Page Bundles","uri":"/tutorials/pagebundles/"},{"content":"Three hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight years, six months, and nineteen days agThree hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight Three hundred and forty-eight The sixth of January, 1482, is not, however, a day of which history has\npreserved the memory.
